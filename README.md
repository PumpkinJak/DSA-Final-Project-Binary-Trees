# DSA-Final-Project-Binary-Trees

This C++ project is an examination of the structure, uses, and advantages of the binary search tree data structure. The program first extracts data from a comma separated values file (csv), examines the data for formatting issues and errors, and packages the data into course objects. These course objects are then used to create and add to the binary search tree structure. The data can then be queried and manipulated by the user. 

The main advantages of the binary search tree data structure is quickly accessing specific elements in the data set. This advantage is even more prominent in extremely large data sets, where it's runtime efficiently really shines. A potential disadvantage emerges when attempting to remove non-leaf elements, as doing so requires a restructuring of the entire subtree of the removed element.
